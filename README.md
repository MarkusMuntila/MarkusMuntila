Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I am an eager new developer who has jumped into the world of software development with a background in business and after working with SAP.
My first focus is on mastering a back-end language. For this I have selected Java as it is one of the most used ones and relatively simple to learn.
My long term goal is to become a full-stack developer who understands many technologies and their benefits and is able to recognize which technology fits each situation.
